# SourceCompanySounds
This sound mod replaces some to most of the main game's default sounds (footsteps, interaction, doors, etc.) from Valve's Source Sounds. (Mostly from CS Source, HL2, some HL1 and few L4D2.) Will continue to add/edit sounds over time until I am satisfied with releasing each update.

**NOT COMPATIBLE WITH** [BlackMesaCompany](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/manicmag/BlackMesaCompany/) as there is two SFX playing at the same time. May also be incompatible with other Source related mods from other publishers. This can be easily fixed but I'll leave that to you.

**All sound tests have been conducted with the in-game master volume set between 15-20% and windows volume set to 100%. Sound volumes may be subject to change with testing and feedbacks.**

***Note:*** *Some to most of these sounds share the same audio with each other. (Example: Stun grenade thrown and Flashlight/Laser drop.) This can be fixed with the help of [LCSoundTool explination in the wiki](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/no00ob/LCSoundTool/wiki/826-replacing-vanilla-audio-clips/) but I am no coding guru.*

*Source games tend to share same sounds across games so there isn't a point in making separate Sound Mods with maybe the exception of HL1 and L4D2. Which will come later, being HL1 is basically done as I worked on that first.*
